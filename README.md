## Studyfi

A place to study, listen to music, and chat with friends. Getting work done while listening to music on one page.

Once logged in with your Spotify account, you can view which song you are currently listening to, and also a Pomodoro Countdown.

- add chat functionality (added on September 5, 2020)
- removed cors policy error ('http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource), and the 503 websocket connection error.

## Summary

During CWF Spring 2020, I decided to make a Shopping List app. I wasn't particularly fond of the existing options on the App Store (either they had ads, or were too feature-heavy), so I decided to make my own! I had my brother Ray (www.linkedin.com/in/rayinoue) mock up some designs for me, and decided to write the app using SwiftUI (Apple's new UI framework) in the spirit of learning something new.

| Expectations (Designs)                         | Reality (Screenshots)                 |

I decided to make a full stack web app using node.js and react.js to help me when studying. I've noticed that most apps that I use when studying are on different platforms (ex: Spotify, Messenger, my iPhone's stopwatch), and that constant switching between platforms and devices would distract me. I decided to make my own web app which would contain all these services in one place, and also to learn more about react.js and node.js.






## Inspiration

There weren't any existing Shopping List apps I was fond of. I don't need recipes, and I also want to be able to input custom foods (aka foods that most apps wouldn't know, aka ethnic foods).






For CWF Fall 2020, I decided to make an app that could help me when I study when on a study term in University. I've noticed that when I'm studying or working on assignments, I usually need 3 things:

- Spotify (or YouTube, any music playing software)
- Facebook Messenger
- and a Stopwatch (to help me keep track of time)

I didn't find any existing apps that had that I liked, and I also wanted to learn more about full stack web development.





## Challenges

The biggest challenge for me was to wrap my head around declarative-style UI progrmaming. After years of writing UI using UIKit (and in Objective-C, to boot), I figured I try using something very different like SwiftUI. Scott had told me that a lot of web frameworks write UI in the same way, so this was a great introduction to that method of thinking, but I definitely ran into some large roadblocks because of the huge paradigm shift. Not to mention all the Swift issues I ran into, since I'm pretty rusty on Swift and haven't really written a meaningful amount in over a year.

Logistically speaking, the co-coding streams helped me to stay motivated and be held accountable so that I work on my project at lesat 6 hours a week, so for once, time management wasn't an issue.

## Reflections

During this time, I feel like I re-learned Swift - it's evolved a lot over the years, and has really started to feel like a langauge of its own (rather than something close to Objective-C). Also SwiftUI! It wasn't quite as easy to make UI as was marketed because I think it required a lot more Swift-y knowledge than most beginners might have. It was quick to make UI's, but I think it took longer for me because I was trying to shake off the UIKit way of creating UI and basically reforming my brain to use this new paradigm. It might've been easier if someone came in with fresh eyes, but it was definitely a little bit more diffficult than I thought.

Not to mention, I found some limitations of SwiftUI itself, in that not everything supported in UIKit is supported yet in SwiftUI (which requires a SwiftUI wrapper of UIKit, which I avoided heavily).

I'm not sure what I would do differently - I maybe would've spent a bit more time on it than I did, but conversely working on this project gave me a sense of how much time it actually takes to learn something and implement brand new things.

Paul Hudsons' Hacking With Swift's SwiftUI guide wins the MVP award for my project - his tutorials were extremely helpful and was the most comprehensive SwiftUI guide I came across.

I would like to keep working on this project, and hopefully ship it to the App Store! I'm gonna set a goal to get this done before the end of the year. Should give me enough time.
